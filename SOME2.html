		<h2>Intuition and Rigor</h2>
		<p>When you take a calculus course,
			you inevitably come across the concepts of "continuity" and "differentiability."</p>
		<p>The definition of a continuous function is vague. You're essentially told that
			a continuous function "can be drawn without your pencil leaving the paper, so to speak."</p>
		<p>Every example of a continuous function looks like this:</p>
		<p>And any example of a discontinuous function looks like this:</p>
		<p>This was the viewpoint of mathematicians for decades. Calculus didn't need to be rigorous;
			it just needed to make intuitive sense.</p>
		<p>But this mindset would shift when Joseph Fourier introduced his famous Fourier series.
			These were infinite sums of trigonometric functions that Fourier used to approximate
			any periodic function. The reason Fourier needed these infinite series was because
			he was trying to solve heat equations from physics.</p>
		<p>When Fourier series were unleashed onto the mathematical scene, people began to worry
			about the lack of rigor that calculus had possessed up till this point. This would
			lead to the rise of precise, rigorous defintions for mathematics as a whole.</p>
		<p>But does any of this extra rigor actually help illustrate facts about calculus
			that wouldn't be obvious through a purely intuitive lens?</p>
		<p>This is the question that we're going to answer today, through the perspective of
			continuous functions and differentiable functions.</p>
		<h2>Continuity and Differentiability</h2>
		<p>(fill in explanation of differentiability here)
			The function \( |x| \) is not differentiable at \( x=0 \).</p>
		<p>So certainly, we are able to find continuous functions that are non-differentiable at
			certain points. But how far can we go? Is it true that a continuous function is always
			differentiable at an infinite number of points? Contrary to the intuitions of most
			mathematicians at the time, the answer is no.
		<p>In fact, in 1872, Karl Weierstrass would prove that there existed continuous functions
			that were <strong>nowhere-differentiable</strong> - or in other words, they were not
			differentiable at any point.</p>
		<h2>Constructing a Continuous, Nowhere-Differentiable Function</h2>
		<p>Does there exist a continuous function that is not differentiable anywhere?
			And if so, what does it look like?</p>
		<p>Let's start with two examples of functions that are not differentiable at \( x = 0 \).</p>
		<p>Take a look at the function \( \sin(1/x) \). You can see that this function oscillates infinitely
			at the point \( x=0 \). Note also that because of this oscillation \( \sin(1/x) \) is not defined at \( x=0 \).</p>
		<p>Now let's define the function \( f(x) \) such that \( f(x) = x\sin(1/x) \) at \( x \neq 0 \) and \( f(x) = 0 \) at \( x = 0 \).
			When graphed, it looks like this:</p>
		<p>As you zoom in on this function at \( x=0 \), it oscillates infinitely just the same as before,
			but we now see that that these oscillations become smaller and smaller as \( x -> 0 \).</p>
		<p>In other words, \( x\sin(1/x) \) actually tends towards a defined value as \( x -> 0 \).</p>
		<p>The idea is this: we construct a function \( g(x) \) that oscillates infinitely at every point,
			but we have the oscillations shrink at just the right speed so that \( g(x) \) is defined and continuous at every point.</p>
